# Particle Park Pro

## Purpose

The purpose of Particle Park Pro is to replace the official libGDX Particle Editor. These are the goals of the project:

* Target all desktop platforms including M1 Macs.
* Disallow any use of Swing, AWT, or similar toolkits. Particle Park Pro is solely a Scene2D.UI project.
* Improve the workflow and interface for maximum efficiency and attractiveness.
* Export libGDX compatible particle effects. Extra features requiring a separate runtime library will not be supported.
* Include all features available in the Particle Editor.

## How to run

You can't run it yet. I haven't made any releases.

## How to create particles

A tutorial on using Particle Park Pro is in development.

## How to contribute

This is a project created by Raymond "Raeleus" Buckley. We are in the design phase. I am not accepting any PR's at this time. You may create an issue in GitHub if there is a feature you want to include. However, I reserve the right to deny all requests.
