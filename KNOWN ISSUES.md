* The file choosers use Native File Dialog Extended. The build, as provided by LWJGL 3.3.2, has a known issue with default paths being ignored. This means that the file choosers will not remember the last used path from session to session. This will be resolved when LWJGL adopts the newest version of Native File Dialog Extended (at least v1.1.0), a new stable release of LWJGL3 is made, libGDX adopts this version, and Particle Park Pro is updated to the latest version. Possible alternatives: switch to an older version of NFD (not recommended due to lacking features, not being able to specify file types) or switch to Tiny File Dialogs (cross OS compatibility has been an issue in the past and needs to be tested thoroughly)
